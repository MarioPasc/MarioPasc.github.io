# Research

    For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by technology and driven by an eagerness to discover new things through curiosity. This passion stems from my father, whose role in shaping my research career has been vital. He introduced me to technology when I was a young child, and together with my mother, consistently encouraged me to pursue a career in science and engineering.

    <p> I spent my early days playing with Legos and memorizing the Star Wars saga. When I was old enough, I received my first Lego Mindstorms set, which was truly a game changer. Through it, I learned to program basic instructions, read sensor data, and debug my numerous mistakes. Most importantly, it sparked a fundamental question that continues to drive my research today: How do machines interact with our world? </p>
