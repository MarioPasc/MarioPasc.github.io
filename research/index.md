# Research

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

    For as long as I can remember, I have always been fascinated by technology and driven by an eagerness to discover new things through curiosity. This passion stems from my father, whose role in shaping my research career has been pivotal. He introduced me to technology when I was a young child, and together with my mother, consistently encouraged me to pursue a career in science and engineering.
